## Self-Evaluation: 
(You may base this on the number of exercises you were able to complete)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:

Since it is very late I would probably be happy with a 15/20 because I get distracted easily so assignments take longer then normal I have set up accommodations so I need to send that email out I spend a decent amount of time on it way longer then it should take but I got it done.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->

I struggled with turning an array to a string but everything else was kind of a refresher from web development but since it has been so long I struggled. Nothing was too interesting it was just annoying that I just could not remember anything from those things because of how long ago it was and the articles and things he put did not help too much. They weren't much of a refresher...

### How long it took you to finish this?

I would say I spent almost over an hour each day since it was due.
